# EchoMTG-GoogleSheets
When added to a Google Sheets via the script editor, the user will be able to input their credentials and pull their card inventory collection into google sheets.

To use, create a new google sheet and select Tools > Script Editor. Paste the javascript into the editor. The code should create two pages, one for your credentials and one which will populate with your collection.

Would be neat to have the this added to the Google Chrome Add-ons store and add other functions from the EchoMTG API.
